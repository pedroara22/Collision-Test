# Collision Test App

The Collision Test App is a web application built using React.js and Matter.js library. This app allows users to experiment with collision detection and physics simulation in a 2D environment.

## Features
- **Interactive Environment**: Create and place shapes within the simulation area.
- **Collision Detection**: Highlight collisions between objects.
- **Physics Simulation**: Objects behave according to physics principles.
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters like shape, size, and properties.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate feedback on object interactions.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Matter.js

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
